# *Assembly Calculator*

## Introduction about the Project
Our team worked together to build a Two-operand simple calculator using assembly language. <br/>
The program performs arithmetic operations such as  addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.<br/>
the symbols of  arithmatic operations is  ( + , - , * , / ).

## Code Features


## Program limitations

  1. Does not allow fractions only integer number.
  2. I'm unable to print the result of a 32-bit numeric multiplication.<br/> 
  hint :(destination of multiplication required the double size of the two register multiplied which is no to be supported )


## Tools
-assembly programming languages <br/>
-masm32(compiler)<br/>
-visual studio code (using terminal to run the code)<br/>
