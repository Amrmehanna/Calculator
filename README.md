# *Assembly Calculator*

## Introduction about the Project
Our team worked together to build a Two-operand simple calculator using assembly language. <br/>
The program performs arithmetic operations such as  addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.<br/>
the symbols of  arithmatic operations is  ( + , - , * , / ).

## Code Features
support basic arithmatic processes (+,-,*,/)

Addition process
Example: Enter the first number, or (e/E) to be: 30
Choose an process (+, -, *, /), or (e/E) to be: +
Enter the second number, or (e/E) to be: 10
Output: result is (+30) + (+10) = +40







## Program limitations

  1. Does not allow fractions only integer number.
  2. I'm unable to print the result of a 32-bit numeric multiplication.<br/> 
  hint :(destination of multiplication required the double size of the two register multiplied which is no to be supported )
