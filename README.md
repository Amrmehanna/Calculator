# *Assembly Calculator*

## Introduction about the Project
Our team worked together to build a Two-operand simple calculator using assembly language. <br/>
The program performs arithmetic operations such as  addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.<br/>
the symbols of  arithmatic operations is  ( + , - , * , / ).

## Code Features
- **Addition Process**
> **Example from the code:** `Enter the fisrt number, or (E/e) to exit: 50`
> 
>`Choose an operation (+, -, *, /), or (E/e) to exit:  + `
>
>`Enter the second number, or (E/e) to exit: 60`
>
> **The Output:** `result is (+50) + (+60) = +110`
 
<br/>

- **substract Process**
> **Example from the code:** `Enter the fisrt number, or (E/e) to exit: 80
> 
>`Choose an operation (+, -, *, /), or (E/e) to exit:-`
>
>`Enter the second number, or (E/e) to exit: 100
>`
>**the output:** result is (80)-(+100)=-20
> <br/>

- **Multiplication Process**
> **Example from the code:** `Enter the fisrt number, or (E/e) to exit: -200`
>
>`Choose an operation (+, -, *, /), or (E/e) to exit: * 
>`
>`Enter the second number, or (E/e) to exit: 10

> **the output:** result is (-200)*(+10)=-2000
> <br/>

- **division  Process**
> **Example from the code:** `Enter the fisrt number, or (E/e) to exit: 100000` `
>
>`Choose an operation (+, -, *, /), or (E/e) to exit: /
>`
>`Enter the second number, or (E/e) to exit: 1000
>`
> **the output:** result is (100000)/(+1000)=+100
> <br/>
> 
- **invalid operator** 
>**Example:** enter the first number ,or (E/e) to exist 10
>
>choose  an process (+,_,/,*) or (E,e) to exist
>
> **output:** <incorrect oerator try another trial>
</br>

-**div by zero**
>**Example:** enter the first number or (E,e) to exist 10
>
>choose process(+,-,/,*), or (E/e) to exist:/
>
>enter second number , or (E,e) to exist :0
>
> **output:**<div by zero is not correct ,,try another trial>
> 
> enter second number,or (E,e) to exist
> </br>


 









## Program limitations

  1. Does not allow fractions only integer number.
  2. I'm unable to print the result of a 32-bit numeric multiplication.<br/> 
  hint :(destination of multiplication required the double size of the two register multiplied which is no to be supported )


## Tools
- Visual Studio Code (using terminal to run the code) <br/>
- Irvine Library<br/>
- Msm32(compiler)
