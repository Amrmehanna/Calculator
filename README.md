# *Assembly Calculator*

## Introduction about the Project
Our team worked together to build a Two-operand simple calculator using assembly language. <br/>
The program performs arithmetic operations such as  addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.<br/>
the symbols of  arithmatic operations is  ( + , - , * , / ).

## Code Features
**Addition Process**
> **Example from the code :** `Enter the fisrt number, or (E/e) to exit: 50`
> 
>`Choose an operation (+, -, *, /), or (E/e) to exit:  + `
>
>`Enter the second number, or (E/e) to exit: 60`
>
> **the Output:** `result is (+50) + (+60) = +110`




## Program limitations

  1. Does not allow fractions only integer number.
  2. I'm unable to print the result of a 32-bit numeric multiplication.<br/> 
  hint :(destination of multiplication required the double size of the two register multiplied which is no to be supported )


## Tools
- Visual Studio Code (using terminal to run the code) <br/>
- Irvine Library<br/>
- Msm32(compiler)
